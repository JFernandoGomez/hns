          &quot;<i>After several bids we decided on Howard and Sons roofing. They included upgrading our old outdated vents with a ridge vent and low profile vents. Ignacio Cesar Peinado was very professional and took the time to make sure we understood everything. He worked around our solar company scheduling and his staff were on time. He provided communication throughout each phase of our roof replacement and even provided cool drone photos upon completion. He was always available to answer any and all of our questions. I would highly recommend Howard and Sons roofing. </i>&quot;<br />

              We actually had six different companies give us estimates for replacing our roof.  All but one company measured the roof exactly the same.  One company measured it 4 square larger but told us we would be credited for the roofing not used.  We liked Dustyn from the very first day that he came ut to do the estimate.  He was always very professional.  He helped us with getting all the information to our insurance company.  Of the diz companies we got the estimates from there were only two we were considering.  One of the reasons we chose Dustyn's Company was because of Dustyn.  He did everything in his power to help us not only with the insurance company but in getting all the information to our morgage company so that we could deposit the insurance check.  The mortgage company needed information faxed over proving we were actually going to use the money for a new roof.  The crew that arrived to tear off the old roof did so in a timely manner.  All the old roofing material was not only stripped off but hauled away. WE were very impressed by the crew.  The crew that installed the roof was very professional arriving in uniform, working constantly and cleaning up any trash from the installation.  We found maybe 2 or 3 nails after the job was complete.  Our neighbors even remarked on how impressed they were by the crew.  One even told us the roofers replacing their roof left quite a mess.  We would definitely recommend Dustyn to anyone in need of a new roof or repair.  We would definitely use them again. </i> &quot;

            &quot;<i>What a great job Howard & Sons did for my roof leak in east Chula Vista! Awesome company. Cesar Peinado, H & Sons San Diego County Regional Manager, a veteran like me, was very professional and extremely helpful, he and his team did a very thorough roof inspection and found the true source of the leaks (which the solar company had not). Cesar provided great details and pictures. He responded at all hours to my texts and emails. He saved me money by creating a plan so only the necessary parts of the roof needed to be replaced, and even helped speak to my insurance company with me, which resulted in me getting reimbursed for thousands of dollars more than they previously had told me. Then the lead installer, also named Cesar, came out and did extra things like chalking a line and meeting the solar people (who had to remove and change solar mounts) so they did their job correctly, so the roofing could be done right. All the Howard & Sons folks were great to work with and very polite to my family. If I could give a rating higher than 5 stars I would! </i>&quot;
